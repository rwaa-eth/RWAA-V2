# RWAA-V2
A new aspect of the RWAA project

- In this version, we are mapping OSM tiles to NFTs. Each NFT is capable of storing notarised documents which are date stamped and hashed on chain. The documents can be verified or provided on request and given permission.
- Each NFT can securely message any other NFT to make private offers or reqest additional information.
